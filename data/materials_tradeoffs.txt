VEHICLE MATERIALS TRADE-OFFS OVERVIEW

Material selection at architecture level directly impacts vehicle mass,
cost, crash performance, manufacturing complexity, repairability, and
long-term durability. Decisions must be evaluated holistically rather
than in isolation.


1. MILD STEEL

Description:
Low carbon steel widely used in automotive structures due to its low cost
and ease of forming.

Typical Applications:
- Non-critical structural members
- Brackets
- Inner panels

Pros:
- Lowest material cost
- Excellent formability
- Easy repairability
- Mature supply chain

Cons:
- High mass
- Limited strength
- Not suitable for modern crash requirements without thickness increase

Architecture-Level Implications:
- Increases overall BIW mass
- May negatively impact fuel efficiency or EV range
- Simple manufacturing processes

Durability and Field Considerations:
- Good fatigue performance
- Requires corrosion protection
- Low repair cost in field


2. HIGH STRENGTH STEEL (HSS / AHSS)

Description:
Steels engineered to provide higher strength-to-weight ratio compared to
mild steel.

Typical Applications:
- Crash load paths
- Pillars (A, B, C)
- Rockers and side sills

Pros:
- Improved crash energy management
- Reduced thickness for same strength
- Cost-effective mass reduction

Cons:
- Reduced formability
- Higher tool wear
- More complex joining requirements

Architecture-Level Implications:
- Enables mass reduction without major cost penalty
- Requires careful load path design
- Influences stamping and springback control

Durability and Field Considerations:
- Higher sensitivity to manufacturing defects
- Repair complexity increases
- Requires trained service infrastructure


3. ALUMINUM

Description:
Lightweight metal increasingly used for mass reduction, especially in EVs.

Typical Applications:
- Closures (hood, tailgate, doors)
- Cast nodes
- Extrusions in load paths

Pros:
- Significant mass reduction
- Corrosion resistance
- Improved vehicle efficiency

Cons:
- Higher material cost
- Joining complexity
- Higher repair cost

Architecture-Level Implications:
- Enables EV range improvement
- Impacts BIW joining strategy
- Requires isolation from steel to prevent galvanic corrosion

Durability and Field Considerations:
- Sensitive to impact damage
- Requires specialized repair processes
- Higher insurance and warranty cost


4. COMPOSITES AND PLASTICS

Description:
Non-metallic materials used for localized mass reduction and design freedom.

Typical Applications:
- Liftgates
- Exterior panels
- Non-structural components

Pros:
- Lowest mass
- Corrosion free
- High design flexibility

Cons:
- High material and tooling cost
- Limited structural capability
- Recycling challenges

Architecture-Level Implications:
- Used selectively due to cost
- Limited crash load carrying role
- Affects manufacturing takt time

Durability and Field Considerations:
- Aging and UV degradation risks
- Repairability challenges
- Replacement often preferred over repair
