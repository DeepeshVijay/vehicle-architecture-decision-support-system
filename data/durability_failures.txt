DURABILITY AND FIELD FAILURE CONSIDERATIONS

Durability issues often emerge years after vehicle launch.
Early architecture decisions strongly influence long-term field
performance, warranty cost, and brand perception.


1. DOOR AND CLOSURE RELATED FAILURES

Common Issues:
- Door sag over time
- Hinge wear and misalignment
- Wind noise development
- Water leakage through seals

Root Causes:
- Insufficient hinge stiffness
- High door mass without reinforcement
- Tolerance stack-up
- Inadequate corrosion protection

Architecture-Level Mitigation:
- Proper hinge load path design
- Conservative stiffness assumptions
- Robust sealing strategy
- Early durability testing


2. BIW STRUCTURAL AGING EFFECTS

Common Issues:
- Loss of local stiffness
- Increased squeaks and rattles
- Fatigue cracking at joints

Root Causes:
- Over-optimized lightweight structures
- Inconsistent joining quality
- Corrosion at load-bearing joints

Architecture-Level Mitigation:
- Balanced lightweighting strategy
- Redundant load paths
- Conservative joint design


3. MATERIAL-RELATED FIELD FAILURES

Steel Structures:
- Corrosion at hem flanges
- Fatigue at spot weld locations

Aluminum Structures:
- Impact sensitivity
- Galvanic corrosion at mixed joints

Composites and Plastics:
- Aging and UV degradation
- Delamination under thermal cycling

Architecture-Level Mitigation:
- Material isolation strategies
- Surface protection and coatings
- Clear repair strategies


4. NVH DEGRADATION OVER VEHICLE LIFE

Common Issues:
- Increased wind noise
- Rattles at interfaces
- Seal hardening

Root Causes:
- Seal compression set
- Loss of fastener preload
- Structural relaxation

Architecture-Level Mitigation:
- Design for long-term sealing compression
- Minimize interfaces
- Avoid over-constrained joints


5. FIELD FEEDBACK AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

Key Learnings:
- Early cost-cutting often increases warranty cost
- Simpler architectures age better
- Manufacturing variation must be assumed, not ignored

Architecture Responsibility:
- Capture lessons learned
- Feed field data into next programs
- Prioritize robustness over marginal gains
