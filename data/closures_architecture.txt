CLOSURES ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

Closures include side doors, tailgates, hood, and related systems.
They directly influence perceived quality, NVH, durability, safety,
manufacturing complexity, and customer satisfaction.


1. FRAMED DOOR SYSTEM

Description:
A door construction where the window glass is supported by a full
metal frame surrounding the glass.

Typical Applications:
- Mass-market vehicles
- SUVs
- Vehicles targeting high NVH performance

Pros:
- Superior sealing performance
- Improved wind noise control
- Better long-term flush and gap stability
- Lower warranty risk in harsh environments

Cons:
- Higher mass compared to frameless doors
- Increased tooling and part count
- Styling constraints due to visible frame

Downstream Impacts:
- Requires stronger A-pillar and roof rail interfaces
- Enables simpler glass regulator design
- Allows more robust weatherstrip design

Durability and Field Risks:
- Lower glass misalignment complaints
- Reduced wind noise complaints over vehicle life
- Better performance in dust, rain, and temperature variation


2. FRAMELESS DOOR SYSTEM

Description:
A door construction without a metal frame around the window glass.
Glass seals directly against body apertures.

Typical Applications:
- Premium sedans
- Coupes
- Styling-focused vehicles

Pros:
- Reduced mass
- Improved styling and perceived sportiness
- Lower beltline visual height

Cons:
- Higher sensitivity to body tolerances
- Increased wind noise risk
- Higher sealing and glass drop calibration effort

Downstream Impacts:
- Requires tighter BIW dimensional control
- Strong dependency on glass regulator accuracy
- Increased development effort for sealing performance

Durability and Field Risks:
- Higher risk of wind noise over time
- Increased glass drop and seal wear issues
- Sensitive to door sag and hinge wear
