MANUFACTURING IMPACTS ON VEHICLE ARCHITECTURE

Manufacturing feasibility is a primary constraint in vehicle architecture.
Early decisions directly affect capital investment, production volume,
quality consistency, and long-term profitability.


1. PRODUCTION VOLUME CONSIDERATIONS

Low Volume Programs:
- Favor simpler structures
- Lower tooling investment preferred
- Manual or semi-automated processes acceptable
- Higher per-unit cost tolerated

High Volume Programs:
- Require high automation
- Justify higher tooling and capital expenditure
- Demand robust and repeatable designs
- Tight process capability requirements

Architecture Impact:
- Platform selection driven by expected volume
- Material and joining strategies depend on volume economics


2. JOINING TECHNOLOGIES

Spot Welding:
- Widely used for steel BIW
- Cost-effective and mature
- Limited suitability for aluminum-intensive structures

Laser Welding:
- Enables continuous joints
- Improves stiffness and sealing
- Higher equipment cost and process sensitivity

Structural Adhesives:
- Improve load distribution
- Enhance NVH and stiffness
- Require curing time and process control

Mechanical Fastening:
- Used for mixed material joining
- Increases part count and assembly time
- Impacts serviceability

Architecture Impact:
- Joining strategy must align with material mix
- Impacts line layout and takt time
- Influences repair strategy


3. TOLERANCE AND DIMENSIONAL CONTROL

Key Considerations:
- Door apertures
- Glass sealing surfaces
- Flush and gap consistency

Architecture Impact:
- Frameless doors demand tighter BIW tolerances
- Mixed material structures increase dimensional variability
- High stiffness structures reduce tolerance stack-up risk

Manufacturing Risks:
- Increased rework
- Higher scrap rates
- Customer-perceived quality issues


4. PLATFORM COMMONALITY AND DERIVATIVES

Benefits:
- Shared tooling
- Reduced development cost
- Faster time-to-market

Challenges:
- Compromises in optimization
- Weight and packaging penalties
- Derivative-specific constraints

Architecture Impact:
- Early definition of hard points critical
- Closure geometry must support derivatives
- Manufacturing flexibility must be designed-in


5. QUALITY AND FIELD FEEDBACK LOOP

Manufacturing Reality:
- Process variation is inevitable
- Design must be robust to variation

Architecture Impact:
- Conservative tolerance assumptions reduce field issues
- Simpler designs age better in mass production
- Over-optimized designs increase warranty exposure
